Greetings!

I'm Radovan Balog, a software engineer originally from a little country called Slovakia. Ever since I was a kid, I had an inclination towards computers, so it made sense to find a job working with computers right out of school. 

My first job though, wasn't a development job. I was only 18 when I joined [2Ring](https://www.2ring.com/) as a Software Tester. While working at 2Ring part-time I studied computer science at [Comenius University in Bratislava](https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/). After a little under two years, it became very apparent that testing wasn't something I wanted to do for long, so I made all the necessary steps to transition to a full-stack engineer. For the next four years, I worked and improved as a Full-stack Engineer, learning how the dev world works, learning how to work in a high velocity team and improving with a large variety of tools, languages and frameworks. We touched everything from an old jQuery web application, to microservices running in the cloud with a modern SPA frontend.

After spending a little over 6 years at 2Ring, I decided it was time for a change. I had bigger ambitions after finishing my bachelor's degree and that's when I joined [ESET](https://www.eset.com/int/). Changing jobs did wonders for my career. I learned how to better communicate with others, got my hands on newer technologies and had the support to take leadership for the frontend development of a completely new project.

After two years, I started feeling like I wanted a bigger challenge; a different environment. After a lot of thinking it through, I moved to the Netherlands. I joined a new company with a recently opened Amsterdam office called [NewGlobe](https://newglobe.education/home-page/). It's here, where I currently contribute to a number of different projects, both old and new.

Even while I'm employed, I try to stay up to date with any new frontend and backend technologies. Occasionally build little experimental projects to get a feel for any new frameworks and libraries. I spend a lot of time reading blogs of other developers, engineers and freelancers, which in part led to me create the page you are seeing right now.

When I'm not spending my time working, I like to spend my time enjoying my hobbies. I love games of all kinds, but have a special soft-spot for board games. I love D&D, both playing and leading. I like watching movies (especially the bad ones) and reading random stuff on the internet, expanding my pointless trivia knowledge.
