Greetings!

I'm Radovan Balog, a quiet software engineer originally from a little country called Slovakia. While I always had an inclination towards computers, my professional journey started right before I started studying computer science at [Comenius University in Bratislava](https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/).

My first job though, wasn't a development job. I was only 18 when I joined [2Ring](https://www.2ring.com/) as a Software Tester. It became very apparent though, that testing wasn't something I wanted to do full-time and I made the transition to a Full-stack engineer after two years. For the next four years, I worked and improved as a Full-stack Engineer, learning how the dev world works and improving with a large variety of tools, languages and frameworks. We touched everything from an old jquery web application, to microservices running in the cloud with a (then) modern SPA.

After spending a little over 6 years at 2Ring, I decided it was time for a change. That was when I joined [ESET](https://www.eset.com/int/). This breath of fresh air resulted in me being one of the first people on a greenfield project, where I eventually took on a Lead frontend role.

After two years, I started feeling like I wanted a bigger challenge and a different environment. This culminated in me moving to the Netherlands. I joined a new company with a recently opened Amsterdam office called [NewGlobe](https://newglobe.education/home-page/). It's here, where I currently contribute to a number of different projects, both old and new.

Even while I'm employed, I try to stay up to date with any new frontend and backend technologies. Occasionally build little experimental projects to get a feel for any new frameworks. I spend a lot of time reading blogs of other developers, engineers and freelancers, which in part led to me create the page you are seeing right now.

The time spent working is not everything there is to offer in life. When I'm not coding, I spend my time enjoying quite hobbies. I love games, both digital and tabletop, I love D&D, movies (especially the bad ones) and listen to a lot of music.
