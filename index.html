<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I’m Radovan Balog, a software engineer originally from a little country called Slovakia. Ever since I was a kid, I had an inclination towards computers, so it made sense to find a job working with computers right out of school.</p>

<p>My first job though, wasn’t a development job. I was only 18 when I joined <a href="https://www.2ring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2Ring</a> as a Software Tester. While working at 2Ring part-time I studied computer science at <a href="https://fmph.uniba.sk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comenius University in Bratislava</a>. After a little under two years, it became very apparent that testing wasn’t something I wanted to do for long, so I made all the necessary steps to transition to a full-stack engineer. For the next four years, I worked and improved as a Full-stack Engineer, learning how the dev world works, learning how to work in a high velocity team and improving with a large variety of tools, languages and frameworks. We touched everything from an old jQuery web application, to microservices running in the cloud with a modern SPA frontend.</p>

<p>After spending a little over 6 years at 2Ring, I decided it was time for a change. I had bigger ambitions after finishing my bachelor’s degree and that’s when I joined <a href="https://www.eset.com/int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESET</a>. Changing jobs did wonders for my career. I learned how to better communicate with others, got my hands on newer technologies and had the support to take leadership for the frontend development of a completely new project.</p>

<p>After two years, I started feeling like I wanted a bigger challenge; a different environment. After a lot of thinking it through, I moved to the Netherlands. I joined a new company with a recently opened Amsterdam office called <a href="https://newglobe.education/home-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewGlobe</a>. It’s here, where I currently contribute to a number of different projects, both old and new.</p>

<p>Even while I’m employed, I try to stay up to date with any new frontend and backend technologies. Occasionally build little experimental projects to get a feel for any new frameworks and libraries. I spend a lot of time reading blogs of other developers, engineers and freelancers, which in part led to me create the page you are seeing right now.</p>

<p>When I’m not spending my time working, I like to spend my time enjoying my hobbies. I love games of all kinds, but have a special soft-spot for board games. I love D&amp;D, both playing and leading. I like watching movies (especially the bad ones) and reading random stuff on the internet, expanding my pointless trivia knowledge.</p>
